Perfect! I'll create a CareBlock smart contract project - a healthcare data management system on blockchain. This will have well-designed data structures for managing patient records, healthcare providers, and medical transactions.CareBlock - Healthcare Blockchain Smart ContractDocument ∙ Version 2 # CareBlock

Perfect! I've created the CareBlock healthcare blockchain project with sophisticated data structures designed specifically for secure medical data management. Here's what makes this design special:
Advanced Data Structures:

Patient struct with authorization mapping for granular provider access
HealthcareProvider struct with reputation system and verification status
MedicalRecord struct with encrypted data storage and multiple record types
Enum for different medical record categories (consultation, prescription, lab results, etc.)

Core Functions:

registerPatient() - Secure patient registration with encrypted data
registerProvider() - Healthcare provider registration with verification system
createMedicalRecord() - Create comprehensive medical records with authorization checks

Key Design Features:

Privacy-First: All sensitive data encrypted and stored via IPFS hashes
Authorization Control: Patients control which providers can access their data
Payment Integration: Built-in consultation fee processing
Emergency Access: Special flagging for emergency medical situations
Audit Trail: Complete blockchain-based medical record history

The data structures are optimized for healthcare scenarios with proper access controls, privacy protection, and scalable patient-provider relationships. The project follows healthcare data standards and includes comprehensive future scope for telemedicine, AI integration, and global healthcare networks.
